# Auto_Comment

This is a simple script written in python which allows you to comment on facebook posts. 
It uses Facebook's Graph API.
I personally used it to reply to all the birthday wishes on my timeline.

Although it can be used for other destructive purposes as well :p 

Go ahead, use it and save time!
